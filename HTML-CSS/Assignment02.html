    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>My name is Emmanuel, a Nigerian and I am 32 years old.
        I started my programming career while pursuing Higher National Diploma Certificate in Electronics Engineering which i obtained in the year 2014 from Federal Polytechnic Offa, Kwara State in Nigeria.
        Then I knew some coding tools in C++. Since then, I have been studying programming languages such as, c, c++, Java. I did some mini projects such as calculator with GUI using Java, and those ones that 
        can only be displayed on the console to apply the programming tools i learnt. 4 years ago, enrolled in Post Graduate Diploma and i learnt HTML/CSS and Php, the tools i combined to build my final year project
        called Web Based Tutor. During this course, i learnt a lot about web programming and some tricks behind it. Throughout my career, I have noticed that I have always been good with identifying problems and solving 
        them. For example,  the project, Web Based Tutor was designed to create a self study platform for which is capable of registering, guiding, assessing, scoring and recording students performance. This was able to
        reduce workload on teachers/instructors and made possible for students to have more contact time as they may wish. Moving forward, I hope to expand my knowledge in web development. Particularly to become a 
        certified full stack web developer which is why I am interested in Knowledgehut.‚Äù</p>
